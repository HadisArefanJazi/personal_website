        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>As AI becomes embedded in critical decision workflows, understanding and mitigating the effects of human attention constraints is increasingly important. My work addresses a fundamental and timely challenge in modern AI-enabled systems: how a human decision-maker should optimally allocate limited cognitive attention across multiple, continuously arriving, and noisy information sources, many of which are increasingly generated or mediated by AI systems. These results provide fundamental insights into how bounded rationality and information constraints shape long-horizon decision behavior.
